        <h1>Welcome! </h1>
        
        <p>I obtained a PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute in 2024. My dissertation was awarded the 2024 Linz-Rokkan Prize for the best EUI dissertation in political sociology. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the ERC-funded project "MoveMeRU" based at the Centre for East European and International Studies and a visiting senior fellow at SCRIPTS, Free University Berlin.

        <p>My interests include the effects of the political regimes, authoritarian attitudinal legacies, and commitments to democracy at the individual level. My work relies on both quantitative and qualitative data. In my dissertation, I used extensive time-series cross-sectional data and large-scale cross-national surveys to explore education quality and skill formation under distinct regimes. Under the ERC-funded project "MoveMeRU", I have been leading focus group data collection to investigate political socialization, attitudes to democracy, and intergenerational transmission among immigrant-background families in liberal democracies. </p>
