        <p>I obtained a PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) in February 2024. My dissertation was awarded the 2024 Linz-Rokkan Prize for the best EUI dissertation in political sociology. </p> 

        <p>Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the ERC-funded project "MoveMeRU" based at the Centre for East European and International Studies and a visiting senior fellow at SCRIPTS, Free University of Berlin. </p>
        
        <p>My interests include political regimes, authoritarian attitudinal legacies, and political preferences. In my dissertation, I examined the effects of political regimes on education quality, skill formation, and critical thinking. My postdoctoral research focuses on political socialization and preferences for democracy among long-standing immigrant families in liberal democracies. 
</p>
        <p>I employ both quantitative and qualitative data in my work. My dissertation utilized extensive time-series cross-sectional data and large-scale cross-national surveys. It also employed a mixed-methods approach, with a focus on educational policies in Russia. As a postdoctoral researcher, I have led focus group data collection, conducting interviews with families from both Russian and non-Russian backgrounds in Estonia, Germany, and Canada.  </p>
