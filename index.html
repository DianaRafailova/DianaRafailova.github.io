        <h1>Welcome! </h1>
        
        <p>I obtained a PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute in 2024. My dissertation was awarded the 2024 Linz-Rokkan Prize for the best EUI dissertation in political sociology. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the ERC-funded project "MoveMeRU" based at the Centre for East European and International Studies and a visiting senior fellow at SCRIPTS, Free University Berlin.

        <p>I study political regimes, authoritarian attitudinal legacies, and commitments to democracy at the individual level. My work relies on both quantitative and qualitative data and analyses. In my dissertation, I used extensive time-series cross-sectional data and large-scale cross-national surveys to explore the effects of political regimes on education quality and skill formation. Under the ERC-funded project "MoveMeRU", I have been leading focus group data collection. Employing original focus group data, I investigate political socialization, attitudes to democracy, and intergenerational transmission among immigrant-background families in liberal democracies. </p>
